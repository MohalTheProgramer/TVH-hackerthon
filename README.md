#Problem statement
In South African townships, most local markets and spaza shops are foreign-owned. Local entrepreneurs struggle to compete because they lack access to affordable bulk purchasing, supplier networks, and efficient logistics. This results in higher stock costs, smaller profit margins, and slower business growth.
Proposed Solutions (ideas)
The digital platform empowers local entrepreneurs and spaza shops to join forces, pool orders, and purchase goods in bulk directly from suppliers at lower prices. The app includes:
•	Group buying features to negotiate discounts.
•	Shared delivery scheduling for reduced transport costs.
•	Info page for government funding and networking events.
•	A marketplace for township businesses to share supplier information and deals.

#Commercialisation
**Transaction Fees:** A small percentage fee(5%) on each bulk order through the platform in 6 months which will encourages scaling . 
Delivery and logistics Services: charge delivery fee for the shared transport scheduling which will be shared among the entrepreneurs. 
**Supplier Partnerships:** Negotiate with wholesalers, distributors, and local manufacturers to secure discounted rates and reliable supply, positioning the app as their gateway to township markets.
Advertising: in-app Advertising space for brands and companies locally found in the townships
Target Audience
Each of these players currently provides goods to spaza shops and township businesses, either directly or through informal networks. While wholesalers and farmers offer bulk products at lower prices, local entrepreneurs and small supermarkets compete for customer loyalty within their communities:
•	Whole Salers
•	farmers
•	local entrepreneur owners 
•	Small township-based supermarkets
•	Community cooperatives

#Competitors
While local markets tend to charge higher prices, making it difficult for small township businesses to compete. The app seeks to address these gaps by enabling collaboration among local entrepreneurs, providing access to bulk purchasing at lower costs, and streamlining order and delivery processes:
•	Expensive local Markets

#Uniqueness
The platform also provides educational support, reduces dependency on undocumented-owned businesses, and encourages collaboration rather than competition among local shop owners, creating a more sustainable and inclusive township marketplace.
**•	For entrepreneurs:** Lower costs, higher margins, and fair competition.
**•	For suppliers:** Access to a wider, organized customer base in townships.
**•	For communities:** Stronger local businesses, job creation, and money circulating within the township economy.

#Security (CIA)
Secure Sign-Up & Login: Use email, phone number, or social login with OTP verification.
User Authentication & Access Control
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Optional
Encryption at Rest: Encrypt sensitive data like user credentials, payment info, and supplier details in the database.
Local Data Minimization: Avoid storing sensitive data unnecessarily on users’ devices.

This Gantt chart outlines a project's timeline over 12 months, breaking down the work into six distinct phases.

 

#Technical Aspects
Page Design & Technology Stack
•	Developed the page layout and visual design using React  for responsive, maintainable front-end components.
•	Implemented the back-end using NodeJS to handle server logic, API endpoints, and integration with machine learning modules.
Key Features & Functionality
•	Machine Learning Prediction: Deployed ML models to forecast inventory demand and recommend products for shop owners based on historical sales data.
•	GPS Tracking: Integrated GPS to monitor the real-time location of users and delivery trucks to optimize route planning.
•	Categorization & Order Optimization: Grouped orders from users by geographic location to consolidate deliveries, reduce under-utilization of trucks, and minimize transportation costs.
•	Wholesaler Sourcing & Logistics Efficiency: Search and partner with local wholesalers to lower procurement costs; optimized transportation by consolidating nearby orders and ensuring vehicles run at high capacity.
